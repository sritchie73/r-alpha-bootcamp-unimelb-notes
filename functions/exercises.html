<h1>Functions exercise.</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a function which takes a numeric vector as argument and calculates the mean of the vector.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function which takes a single numeric value X as argument and returns a logical value which is TRUE if X is larger than 15, or FALSE otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend the previous function by including an extra argument which sets the threshold (i.e. 15 in the previous question).</p></li>
<li><p>Create a vector with values between 1:100. Take the function from question 1 and use it in an <code>sapply</code> (If I haven&#39;t covered <code>sapply</code> yet, wait till the next section to do this) and elements larger than 72 in the vector.</p></li>
</ol>
