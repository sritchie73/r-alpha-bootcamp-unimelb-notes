<h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>

<p><a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/post/96944885049/explainer-cloud-computing">This post</a> summarises cloud computing and why it might be useful to researchers.</p>

<h2>Why are we using the cloud at this bootcamp?</h2>

<p>The cloud is a useful tool for Software Carpentry bootcamps because (a) at regular bootcamps a lot of time is wasted dealing with software installation issues, and (b) tools like the UNIX Shell look and behave slightly differently depending on which operating system you&#39;re using (i.e. Windows, Mac OS X or Linux), which can be confusing for beginners. By using the cloud we can setup a bunch of computers with exactly the same operating system and with the software already installed.    </p>

<h2>&ldquo;DIT4C&rdquo; on the NeCTAR Reasearch Cloud</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/about">Research Bazaar</a> project is funding an initiative called Data Intensive Tools for the Cloud (DIT4C), which aims to get researchers using the <a href="http://www.nectar.org.au/research-cloud">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a>. Any researcher at an Australian university can apply for access to the NeCTAR Research Cloud, however for the purposes of this bootcamp we&#39;ll be using a DIT4C interface designed specifically for Software Carpentry activies. To access the enviroment, head to this URL:</p>

<h4>Notes on the DIT4C cloud environment:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The DIT4C environment comes with Nano for text editing at the command line, but no text editor like Notepad++, Kate or TextWrangler. A good tutorial for beginners to Nano can be found <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/">here</a>. </li>
<li>On a Mac, <code>command</code><code>+</code> doesn&#39;t work for zooming in the shell environment. Instead, hold down <code>control</code> and scroll with the mouse</li>
<li>In Firefox and Safari, cut and paste doesn&#39;t work in the shell terminal. Chrome and Internet Explorer are fine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Useful resources</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re going to be doing a lot of remote computing as part of your research (on a supercomputer or in the cloud), Software Carpentry also has a couple of useful lessons:</p>
