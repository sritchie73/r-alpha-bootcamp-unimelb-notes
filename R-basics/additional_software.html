<p><strong>Make</strong> <em>installation necessary only for Windows</em></p>

<p>Linux and Mac users already have Make pre-installed. Windows users will need to install Make separately to work with Gitbash. Please follow these instructions below if you have a windows laptop. If you run into trouble please ask one of the helpers to assist you.</p>

<li>To convert documents to PDF you&#39;ll need LaTex installed. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Latex</strong> <em>Only for Windows and Mac users</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html">For Mac users</a> For today please just install <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/mactex-basic.pkg">BasicTex</a><br/>
<a href="http://miktex.org/download">For Windows users</a> ~ 155 mb</p>
