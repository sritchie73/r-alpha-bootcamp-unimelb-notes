<p>This lesson contains a Rmd file with code for and descriptions of several useful features of the <code>data.table</code> library, which is much much faster than base R for a range of data processing tasks. </p>

<p>The lesson should take around <strong>15 minutes</strong> to work though, more if there is discussion of the special <code>data.table</code> syntax.  For a similar library, also useful to speed up table calculations, students may also want to check out Hadley Wickam&#39;s recently released <a href="http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/01/17/introducing-dplyr/">dplyr library</a>.</p>
