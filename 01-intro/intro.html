<p>Here&#39;s the dream:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Computers have revolutionized research, and that revolution is only
beginning. Every day, scientists and engineers all over the world use
them to study things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow,
too expensive, too dangerous, or just too hard to study any other way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now here&#39;s the reality:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every day, scientists and engineers all over the world waste time
wrestling with computers. Tasks that should take a few moments take
hours or days, and many things never work at all. And even when things
<em>do</em> work, most scientists have no idea how reliable their results
are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the pain that researchers feel stems from not knowing how to
develop software systematically, how to tell if their programs are
working correctly, how to share their work with others (except by
mailing files to one another), or how to keep track of what they&#39;ve
done. This sorry state of affairs persists for four reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <em>No room, no time.</em>
Everybody&#39;s curriculum is fullâ€”there&#39;s simply not space to add more
about computing without dropping something else.</li>
<li>  <em>No standards.</em>
Reviewers and granting agencies don&#39;t check whether software is
correct, ask how long it took to write, or count it toward tenure,
so there&#39;s no incentive for scientists to do better.</li>
<li>  <em>The blind leading the blind.</em>
Senior researchers can&#39;t teach the next generation how to do things
that they don&#39;t know how to do themselves.</li>
<li>  <em>The cult of big iron.</em>
Attention and funding mostly goes to things that politicians and
university presidents can brag about on opening day, rather than
to the basic skills that almost everyone uses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal is to show scientists and engineers how to do more in less
time and with less pain.  Our lessons have been used by more than four
thousand learners in over a hundred two-day workshops since the spring
of 2010.  Here&#39;s how they can help:</p>

<ul>
<li>  If you&#39;ve ever overwritten the wrong file,
we&#39;ll show you how to use version control.</li>
<li>  If you&#39;ve ever spent hours typing the same commands over and over again,
we&#39;ll show you how to automate those tasks using simple scripts.</li>
<li>  If you&#39;ve ever spent an afternoon trying to figure out what the program you wrote last week actually does,
we&#39;ll show you how to break your code into modules that you can read, debug, and improve piece by piece.</li>
<li>  If you&#39;ve ever spent days copying and pasting data in text files and spreadsheets,
we&#39;ll show you how a database can do the work for you.</li>
</ul>
